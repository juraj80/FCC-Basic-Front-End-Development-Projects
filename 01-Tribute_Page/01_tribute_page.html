      <p>and one of the Soviet Union's best-kept secrets.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov</strong> (12 January 1907 â€“ 14 January 1966) was the lead Soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft designer in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s. He is considered by many as the father of practical astronautics.</p>
      
      <p>Although Korolev was trained as an aircraft designer, his greatest strengths proved to be in design integration, organization and strategic planning. Arrested for alleged mismanagement of funds (he spent the money on unsuccessful experiments with rocket devices), he was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six years, including some months in a Kolyma labour camp. Following his release, he became a recognized rocket designer and a key figure in the development of the Soviet Intercontinental ballistic missile program. He was then appointed to lead the Soviet space program, made Member of Soviet Academy of Sciences, overseeing the early successes of the Sputnik and Vostok projects that include launching Yuri Alexeevich Gagarin into orbit on 12 April 1961, the first human in space. By the time he died unexpectedly in 1966, his plans to compete with the United States to be the first nation to land a man on the Moon had begun to be implemented.

Before his death he was often referred to only as "The Chief Designer", because the Soviet leadership feared that the United States would send agents to assassinate him. Only many years later was he publicly acknowledged as the lead man behind Soviet success in space. His death was a blow to the Soviet space program: a loss that in many ways was irreplaceable. Sergei Pavlovich Korolev's many pioneering achievements in space exploration include:</p> <br> 
      
      <ul>       
      <!--  <li>Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, a Ukrainian, was born in Zhitomir, Russia on December 30, 1906.  </li> -->
         <li>The R-7 rocket, the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile launched on August 21, 1957 </li>
         <li>Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite (launched on October 4, 1957) </li>
         <li>The world's first space passenger, the dog Laika, launched on Sputnik 2 a month later </li>
         <li>The Luna series, the first unmanned vehicles to orbit and land softly on the moon </li>
        <li>The Vostok series of spacecraft (launched from 1960 to 1963), which were the first manned spacecraft and featured Yuri Gagarin's first manned mission on April 12, 1961 </li>
        <li>And the Voskhod program (1964 to 1966) the world's first multi-person spacecraft, which included the first spacewalk on March 18, 1965</li>
        <p>Korolev's legacy includes a city named after him (formerly Kalingrad, Russia), Korolev Crater on the Moon, Korolev Crater on Mars, and asteroid 1855 Korolev. </p><br>
      </ul>
        <p> Sergei Pavlovich Korolev quotes:</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>
       <p>"I've been waiting all my life for this day!" (Upon the launch of Sputnik.) </p>
       <p>"The Soviet Union has become the seacoast of the universe." (After the launch of Sputnik.) </p>
       <p> "The Americans have unified their forces into a single thrust, and make no secret of their plans to dominate outer space. But we keep our plans secret even to ourselves..."</p>
        </h4>
      </ul>
